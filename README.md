AP US Government Interest Group Project

A project for AP US Government at Maggie Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies during the 2016-2017 school year. I and a team of three others developed a website for a fake interest group, ALIEN, or the American League for Interplanetary Exploration and Navigation, devoted to forwarding American presence beyond Earth's atmosphere.
