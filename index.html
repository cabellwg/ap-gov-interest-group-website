            The American League for Interplanetary Exploration and Navigation recently denounced Alfonso Cuaron’s 2013 film Gravity for its “scientifically bankrupt perception of space.” Spokesperson Carina Qin called for Cuaron to apologize for the scientific inaccuracies and encouraged the public to research space rather than relying on popular media narratives. &nbsp;<a href="#">Read more ></a>

          The mission of the American League for Interplanetary Exploration and Navigation is to develop the astronautical capabilities of the United States and her allies to expand mankind to other planets, by:
            <ul>
              <li>Lobbying for greater governmental priority for interplanetary exploration,</li>
              <li>Advocating for increased funding for NASA,</li>
              <li>Encouraging private development of astronautical technologies, and</li>
              <li>Increasing public interest in the exploration of space.</li>
            </ul>
          We believe that developing astronautical capabilities is essential because interplanetary habitation is the only viable path for the long-term survival of the human race, and because in pursuing interplanetary habitation, advances in science and medicine will be made that will offer potentially groundbreaking advances in human welfare.
